      "Project: TDS Virtual TACreate a virtual Teaching Assistant Discourse responder.BackgroundYou are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras’ Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course.Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:Course content with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.TDS Discourse posts with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.Scrape the dataTo make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.Create an APIYour application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at https://app.example.com/api/.The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.For example, here’s how anyone can make a request:curl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopiedThis is a real question and uses this screenshot:The response must be a JSON object like this:{\n  \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`.

        "Tools in Data Science - Jan 2025Tools in Data Science is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\nThis course exposes you to real-life tools\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.But one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself.You learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace.You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a sed + grep script in minutes. “We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You’ll have to decode the regexes yourself.”In this course, we’ve curated the most important tools people use in data science.Learn them well. You’ll be a lot more productive than your peers.\n\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:It used to be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#LLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#The ROE is hard.\n#Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\n\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\nYou need a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.But isn’t this a data science course? Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, some of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you do need programming to learn many of them.\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeksThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the commit history for changes.Released content:Development Tools and concepts to build models and apps.
